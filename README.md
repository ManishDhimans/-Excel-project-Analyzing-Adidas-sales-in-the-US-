Hello everyone
🌟 Excited to Showcase My 2nd Project With Excel: Analyzing Adidas Sales in the US 📊

>>About The Project
The goal of the project is to provide useful information that can help improve Adidas’ sales performance in various retail outlets, cities, and regions across the United States. The project aims to analyze Adidas sales trends, customer behavior, and more, aiming to increase sales and profitability. By identifying key insights and trends, the project can help Adidas make data-driven decisions leading to better business outcomes.

>>I undertook this project by applying a diverse skill set:

1--Data Gathering:
Collected essential data for analysis.

2--Data Scrubbing:
Ensured data integrity by: Checking and refining data structure.
Identifying and handling missing values.
Validating data types.
Eliminating duplicate entries.
Managing null values.

3--Data Visualization:
Presented insights visually through:
Development of pivot tables.
Generation of reports.
I am communicating analysis outcomes in a clear and accessible manner.

-- Insights:
👉 Adidas: $900M in sales, $332M in profit - a powerhouse performance!
👉 Charleston and New York stole the show as the top cities, with a remarkable sales spike in 2021, especially during winter, peaking in July and December.
👉 West Gear claimed the throne as the most profitable retailer, closely followed by Foot Locker.
👉 Consumer behavior insights - in-store purchases reign supreme, with a notable rise in online transactions in 2021.
